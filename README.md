# STM32F4_Projects
# Embedded Software Learning Journey with STM32F4

This repository contains projects that I've created while learning embedded software development with STM32F4 microcontrollers. The projects include GPIO, UART, PWM, ADC, and more.

## ðŸ“‚ Project List

- **[Button Controlled LED Blink](Blinking_LED/01_Button_LED_Blink.c)** â†’ This project demonstrates controlling an LED using a button with GPIO and delays.
- **[UART Communication](-)** â†’ UART communication between STM32 and a computer.
- **[PWM Servo Control](-)** â†’ PWM control for servo motors.

Each project has its own README.md with detailed instructions.
